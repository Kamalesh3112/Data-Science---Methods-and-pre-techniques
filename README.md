# Data Science -Methods-and-pre-techniques
It contains and covers most of the techniques that can be and used in most of the machine learning , Data Analytics and Data Analysis . It consist of including Regressions , Classifiers and insightful algorithms that can used in many data functionalities.

Some classification techniques, such as decision trees, SVMs and neural networks, can also be used to do regressions.

In this Google Colab notebook(.ipynb format) , it may contain some errors but the cells will be look good if runned again from the initial cell according to the algorithms used in this environment.

I have uploaded some portable documents about Data Science and also with an Image file that tells the comparison between Data Science and Data Analytics.


# Machine Learning - What is meant by that? You can find it below!
Machine learning (ML) is the process of using mathematical models of data to help a computer learn without direct instruction. Itâ€™s considered a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning uses algorithms to identify patterns within data, and those patterns are then used to create a data model that can make predictions.
